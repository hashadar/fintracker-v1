# FinTracker

A financial dashboard and analytics application built with Streamlit for tracking and analysing personal financial assets.

## Data Privacy

This repository is configured to exclude financial data files from version control. The following files are ignored:
- Excel files (*.xlsx, *.xls)
- CSV files (*.csv)
- Financial data directories

To use the application:
1. Place your financial data files in the project directory
2. Ensure the files follow the required data structure
3. The files will remain local and will not be committed to the repository

## Overview

FinTracker is a financial dashboard that provides insights into financial portfolios, including cash positions, investments, and pensions. The application offers overviews and detailed analytics for each asset type.

## ETL Process

The application processes financial data through the following ETL pipeline:

1. **Extract**
   - Data is extracted from Excel files (e.g., `202506_equity_hd.xlsx`)
   - Required columns: Timestamp, Platform, Asset, Value

2. **Transform**
   - Timestamps are converted to datetime format
   - Assets are categorised into types (Cash, Investments, Pensions)
   - Data is aggregated to ensure one entry per platform-asset per month
   - Duplicate entries are resolved by using the latest value

3. **Load**
   - Processed data is cached for performance
   - Data is filtered based on selected date ranges
   - Metrics are calculated in real-time
   - Visualisations are generated on demand

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fintracker-v1.git
cd fintracker-v1
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install dependencies:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Use the sidebar to:
   - Select date ranges for analysis
   - Navigate between different views (Overview, Cash Deep Dive, etc.)
   - Filter and analyse specific asset types

## Data Structure

The application requires financial data in an Excel file format with the following structure:
- Timestamp: Date of the record
